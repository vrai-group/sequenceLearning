# Sequence Learning
The aim of the project is to build a model that can analyze data from domotic sensors in order 
to predict the behavior of a user. To this end, two approaches have been used. One with the 
Hidden Markov Chain model, made with larsmans libraries([link](https://github.com/larsmans/seqlearn))
and the other with a Neural Networks model, made with keras. The models have been trained and 
tested with the Milan dataset ([link](http://ailab.wsu.edu/casas/datasets/)).
